# covidCasesByCountyNJ
simple python program that uses selenium and beautifulsoup4 to scrape the nj health website for daily updates on covid data
TODO
  -make a GUI for the data visualization
  -find more lightweight tool for scraping dynamic js loaded websites like the one on njhealth (selenium is too heavy)
